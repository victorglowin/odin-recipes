    <ol>
        <li><strong>PREPARE THE CHICKPEAS</strong></li>
        Boil 1 cup of dried chickpeas until semi-cooked (about 45 minutes to an hour). Drain water.
        Add fresh water and ½ tablespoon of cumin. Boil chickpeas a second time for another 30 minutes.
        Once chickpeas are cooked, squeeze ½ of a lime over chickpeas.
        <li><strong>FRY THE ONIONS</strong></li>
        Chop 2 medium onions into circles. Mix with flour and set aside for 30 minutes prior to frying.
        Fry in oil, preferrably sunflower oil. Using a frying spatula, remove the onions from the oil. Set onto a paper towel and set aside.
        Keep the sunflower oil to use some of it in other parts of the recipe.
        <li><strong>MAKE THE FRESH RED SAUCE</strong></li>
        Blend 3 tomatoes, 1 bell pepper, ½ medium onion, and 3 garlic cloves in the food processor.
        If you would like a spicy sauce, add 1 spicy pepper.
        Add ½ teaspoon of ground cumin, ½ teaspoon of ground coriander, 1 tablespoon of oil (from the fried onions), salt, and pepper. Add juice from 1 lime.

        Blend 1.5 medium onions in a food processor.
        In a high-rimmed stovetop pot, add 2 tablespoon of oil (from the fried onions). Cook the onions on medium heat for about 15 minutes.

        Turn down heat to medium-low. Add 2 cups of dry rice and 1 more cup of water.
        Add salt and pepper. Mix the koshari rice and cover.
        Continue to cook on medium-low heat covered until the rice has finished cooking (about 12 minutes).
        Turn off the stove and allow the rice to rest covered for 5 minutes.

        Add the spaghetti pasta and elbow pasta to the boiling water.
        Cook the pasta until desired firmness.
        Drain the pasta and set it aside.

        Add 2 tablespoon of tomato paste and 2 tablespoon of vinegar for about 30 seconds before adding the blended tomatoes.
