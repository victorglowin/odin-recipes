    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> A tasty breakfast dish native to Egypt. It is made using fava beans, mashed into a chunky purée along with garlic, lemon and tahin</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>400g can fava beans (available online) or broad beans</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>100ml olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp chilli flakes</li>
        <li>2 large, ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped (or 200g can of chopped tomatoes, if tomatoes aren't in season)</li>
        <li>lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tahin</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Drain the beans and rinse. Fill the empty, clean can with water and pour into a saucepan with the beans. Bring them to the boil to warm through, then take them off the heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a separate medium frying pan, gently fry the onion and garlic in all but a few tablespoons of the olive oil for 5 mins, then add 2 tsp sea salt flakes, the cumin, chilli flakes and tomatoes. Drain the beans, reserving some of the cooking liquid. Add to the onion mixture and cook over a low heat for 30 mins, stirring often and adding some of the cooking liquid if it looks dry.</li>
        <li>Using a potato masher, mash the beans with the remaining olive oil, lemon juice and tahini. The final consistency should be a chunky, soft purée. If it splits slightly, mix in a drop of cold water.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Serve as desired and enjoy!</p>
