This is a basic recipe website created using simple html. It describes in detail how to prepare 3 African dishes. First, a quick description of the dish is given. Second, the ingredients required to make the dish is listed, and finally, a step by step tutorial on how to prepare the dish is outlined.
Upon completion of this project, I hope to have demonstrated a solid foundational knowledge of html, as a well the ability to write clean code.This website will be stlyed with CSS in the future.
